# SqueakSSL Plugin
SqeakSSL is a plugin based interface to the native SSL/TLS facilities on your platform. On Windows, it uses the SChannel SSPI, on Unix it uses the OpenSSL implementation, and on the Mac it uses the Apple SSL interface.

This project hosts the plugin bits of SqueakSSL. For the Squeak bits, see http://www.squeaksource.com/SqueakSSL.html
